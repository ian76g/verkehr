you are the rider of the bicycle - if you click the bicycle you drive into the intersection.
If there is no other car that has right of way at the crossing you get a point and a new puzzle.

If there are other cars that have right of way, your points drop to zero.

Before you pass a stop sign, you have to stop your bike. click the stop sign to indicate that you have stopped.

Any puzzles that are not working correctly can be reconstructed via the given puzzle link.
Maybe someone can fix them?
